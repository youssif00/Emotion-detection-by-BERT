# Emotion Detection from Tweets BY BERT

Project Overview

Social media users express a variety of emotions in short messages. Accurately detecting these emotions enables applications in customer support, mental health monitoring, and more. In this project, we fine-tune a BERT-based model (bert-base-uncased) to classify tweets into one of six emotions: sadness, joy, love, anger, fear, and surprise.
